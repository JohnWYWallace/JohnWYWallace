**`IOS Software Engineer (Swift/C)`**

I currently am in University at UNF (University of North Florida) pursing my Bachelors in Computer Science. In my free time I tinker with the Swift langauge and Xcode and make little apps. Every since I was a young kid I was fascinated with Apple devices and the software that powers them. I knew since the first time I saw one I wanted to make apps for the app store. Full stack IOS developer is what I want to make of my career.

 <summary><h3>ðŸ¤– John's 0's and 1's Journey</h3></summary>
   It all begin when I was a sophomore at St. Johns River State College pursuing my Associate in Arts degree when I decided to take an Intro to Programming Course. In this class is where I begin to fall in love with coding. It was a course where we would make fun little story games and just learn the basics or programming. The language we were learning was Python and I had no idea that this was the begining of a journey that would change the course of my life forever! Sadly, this course was cut short right when it was getting interesting due to the Covid pandemic and I had to continue learning Python at my home. Fast forward to the Summer of 2021 when Covid restrictions started to loosen up, I resumed going back to school at the University of North Florida, where I took Programming I and started to learning the language C. This course started to show me alot more that can be done with coding like creating your own functions and using conditionals and simple logic to make your program do something simple like find the largest value or get the average of many numbers. Coming into my junior year at i am feeling a lot more confident in my ability to program and take Programming II where we started to learn Java. The only thing I knew about Java up to this point was that Minecraft was originally made in Java so I knew it was a powerful language if it could make such a rich and enjoyable game like that. With that prereq knowledge coupled with my fascination of coding made me eager to start this class. This class had a lot of tough concepts that I only heard about thorugh YouTubers that I watched on YouTube which are OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. By the end of this class I felt more confident in my coding abilities than I ever did before. I was able to create a login system that takes in a username and password and if and only if they match in the hashmap will it allow the user to go to the next screen. When i presented this to my class I felt so proud of myself showing them something I worked so hard on and something I could call my own. I felt like Steve Jobs presenting a new revolutionary product. This project is on my GitHub called LoginGUI if you would like to take a look at the source code and check out the UI because it was made using GUIs. Upon taking this class I would take Data Structures and Computer Architecture and Organization. This was by far the most coding heavy semesters of my college career and I couldnt be happier. Data Structures showed me all sorts of ways to search for a particular piece of data in an array like Binary searching, sorting through an array, insertion sorting and merge sorting, and Binary Search Trees to just name a few. This class was a definite eye opener to all the different ways you can manipulate data anbd how some methods are more efficient than others. Computer Architecture and Organization taught me alot about logic gates, register transfers and the overal basic organiztion and design of a computer. We used the MIPS assembly language with the MARS simulator which was so dificult to learn at first but I ended up getting the hang of it and doing well getting a good grasp of what assembly langauge is all about.  Heading into the summer I begin to trying to learn other languages like Swift. Ive always been an Apple super fan and would jainbreak my iPod when I was kid to get cool software tweaks and get apps not available on the app store. My dream is to become a IOS developer and make incredible IOS apps. I started to do tutorials and took Anegla Yu's Swift course on Udemy and started grinding trying to learn about Swift and Xcode. I concurrently took her course with two other courses at school which were Databases and Computer Networks. These two courses were super helpful learning about SQL and how to connect a database with a program and being able to insert data, retreive data, edit data and delete data. Computer Networks was sa super complex course learning all about how devices connect to routers and how packets of data is sent over the internet. This is my journey so far. Stay tuned....ðŸ“º
