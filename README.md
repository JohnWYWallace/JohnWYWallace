**`IOS Enthusiast (Swift/C)`**

I currently am in University at UNF (University of North Florida) pursing my Bachelors in Computer Science. In my free time I tinker with the Swift langauge and Xcode and make little apps. Every since I was a young kid I was fascinated with Apple devices and the siftware that powers them. I knew since the first time I saw one I wanted to make apps for the app store. Full stack IOS developer is what I want to make of my career.
